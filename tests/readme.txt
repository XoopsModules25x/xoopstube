This directory contains tests cases to be used with Selenium IDE, an extension for Firefox:

http://seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/

The tests have been created on XOOPS 2.5.6 on a local host (WAMP Server).

The default test URL is:

http://localhost/xtest256/

You should change it to your environment in all the test files.

Please note: these tests are running on a fresh installation of the module. Sometimes they depend on an ID of an element that could be incremented by XOOPS when you delete one and add another one. Then the test won't work. You can modify the test files accordingly, or reinstall the module and then run the tests.
